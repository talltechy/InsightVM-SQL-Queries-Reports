         * For every vulnerability to which an asset is currently vulnerable, there will be one fact record.
         * The record indicates when the vulnerability was first found, last found, and its current age.
         * The age is computed as the difference between the time the vulnerability was first discovered on the asset, and the current time.
         * If the vulnerability was temporarily remediated, but rediscovered, the age will be from the first discovery time.
         * If a vulnerability was found on a service, remediated and discovered on another service,
         * the age is still computed as the first time the vulnerability was found on any service on the asset.
