   <description>The Vulnerability Aging Detail Report takes this idea one step further and answers &quot;What assets and vulnerabilities am I vulnerable to that have been discovered in the last 30, 60, 90, and 90+ days?&quot;. The report offers detailed break-down by site, asset, and vulnerability. Each count displays the total number of instances of that vulnerability found on the asset. You can also see a breakdown of how many assets have at least one vulnerability in each severity and time category, for each site, and across your entire report scope.</description>
