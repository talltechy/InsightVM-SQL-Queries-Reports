<ReportTemplate id="vulnerability-32count-32comparison" name="Vulnerability Count Comparison" type="jasper" deprecated="false" builtin="0">
   <description>This report template provides you with a list of all your vulnerabilities in a selected site(s), asset group(s) or asset(s) and compares the total number of current instances to the number of instances as of 30 days ago. The report template also provides you with a +/- difference from one time period to the other and is sorted descending by the absolute value of the difference, placing large differences, in either direction, at the top of the report. What a great way to see the most prolific vulnerabilities in your environment, monitor remediation efforts and identify problem areas at a glance. Additionally, vulnerabilities that are completely remediated are reported as a &quot;Current&quot; count of 0, showing you which vulnerabilities you have eliminated from from your environment within the reporting period.</description>
